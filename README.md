# TimeFlow

## Overview

The **TimeFlow App** is a productivity tool based on the **Pomodoro Technique**, designed to help you stay focused and manage your work sessions effectively. The app allows you to set customizable session and break lengths, and it includes an alarm feature to notify you when a session is completed. This app is built using **React** and offers a user-friendly interface.

## Features

- Set customizable session and break lengths.
- Automatic switch between session and break modes.
- Play an alarm sound to signal the end of a session.
- Start, stop, and reset the timer.
- Increase break session duration after completing a set number of Pomodoros.

## Acknowledgments

I started this project initially as part of the FreeCodeCamp [Front End Libraries Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries). I later veered off to explore and add more features.

This project was inspired by the Pomodoro Technique, a time management method developed by [Francesco Cirillo](https://francescocirillo.com/).
